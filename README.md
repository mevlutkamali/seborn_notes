There is a study containing basic commands and notes about the Python Seborn library . . .

Seaborn is a library for data visualization and data analysis in the Python programming language . Seaborn is based on the matplotlib library specifically for creating statistical plots and offers a high-level interface to make data visualization processes easier . This library is designed to speed up data analysis work and create more attractive and meaningful graphs .

And I am sending you brief summary notes about this library here . . .
